# push-stream-examples

this is a short introduction to push-streams.
if you liked pull-streams, this will bend your mind the other way around.
if you thought pull streams were too hard to read, all the nested closures,
you may be pleasantly surprised to see flat object oriented code.

so far there is just [index.js](./index.js) which covers the basics.
